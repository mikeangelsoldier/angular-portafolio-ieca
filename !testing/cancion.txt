Look in front of you
I'm sure this is the girl
But she's not for you
You're a creep and she's a belle
You think she looks at me?
Am I invisible?
She's just playing with you
I don't know how to do
You told me (I told you)
To dance with her
Trying to do it
I was there, she doesn't care
She still ignores me
Dancing with her friends
Tell me how to do
Maybe it's over
You thought it was so easy
Show her who you are
You told me (I told you)
Talk with her
She didn't hear my voice
She didn't hear my name
Shyness is her game
Now I have no choice
You told me (I told you)
Just kiss her
You told me (I told you)
Just kiss her
Now she's good for us
Now she's good for us
